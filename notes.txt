#Should be an installer for this compiler or this runtime
#that pulls the git repo for the project if one of the scripts is executed
#And the runtime does not exist yet
#So the installer prepends itself with on the script (note: actually append and call with 
#function as we do not want to have the installer before the actual content)


#Make proxy scripts instead
#As the documentation might change we need to make a proxy so that only the latest code is executed

#Execute webpages


#1. Proxy executed
#2. Check installed (whereis)
#3. Check if installer is somewhere
#4. Check online



# TODO replace None returns by exceptions
