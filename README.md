# rnmd - markdown execution runtime

Why? Execute code contained in markdown documentation.

Sadly i can not use rnmd in the project itself otherwise i would.

The choice for using LGPL 2.1 is strategic so if i may stop developing the runtime
it will still receive  bugfixes/improvements from entities using this software in their programs.

As you could build whole programs based on the rn_md runtime (markdown -> script) interpreter
the GPL licence is not the way to go as it probably would make those programs GPL as well,
which in turn hurts adoption of this project as it would pretty much restrict its
usage to GPL programs only.

Because of these reasons the LGPL2.1 Licence was chosen.
